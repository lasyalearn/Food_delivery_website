which will run on localhost:3000

now intall when we code in app function in app js 
and when we install something seperately  it should be added in the dependencies
but  if place the <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-dark-5@1.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap-night.min.css" rel="stylesheet"> on top of the head the no need to install bootstrap and and it in dependecies
the  dependecire\es are present in package.json file 
also the fs-1 class is part of bootstrap (ig)😅
