## intial setup-------(if ur building from scratch😁)
npx create-react-app food_app ---> is used to create the react app ------> food_app folder is created with some pre-written files
to run the react app you need to enter the food_app folder --------> cd food_app ------> then ----->npm start
Now u will the default react web site
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b157459-4052-461a-9368-83d32c2d78dc)
which will run on localhost:3000
now intall when we code in app function in app js 
and when we install something seperately  it should be added in the dependencies
but  if place the <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-dark-5@1.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap-night.min.css" rel="stylesheet"> on top of the head the no need to install bootstrap and and it in dependecies
the  dependecire\es are present in package.json file 
also the fs-1 class is part of bootstrap (ig)😅----> it is used to increase the font size

## Compoents for the react page
components are something which are reuseble
Let's learn how to create various components in react
create a new folder called components in src and each which we will create file in components will be a component of the react web page 
All the component file should start with a capital letter.
1. component we will create is Navbar.js (inside if tpye rfc ---> we will get the default code )

## 📕Notes
1.it seems in react function we can't have multiple divs ---> to help with this we need to enclose in the multiple div in a empty parent tag<></>  or a div(a div can have multiple div tages inside of it)
2.after creating a component in the components folder it won't reflect in main app web page unless we need import th file and use it as a tag
